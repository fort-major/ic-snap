Project Overview
This project aims to create a streamlined experience for users interacting with the MSQ wallet. We focus on modern design principles using Tailwind CSS, ensuring responsiveness and an intuitive user interface.

SCSS to Tailwind Conversion
In the migration process, we transitioned from SCSS styles to Tailwind CSS. This allowed us to leverage utility-first styling, simplifying our CSS structure and enhancing maintainability. We ensured that all components are responsive, adapting seamlessly to various screen sizes for optimal user experience.

Using Vite Instead of a Static Server
We opted for Vite as our development server, which offers fast refresh and hot module replacement. This choice eliminates the need to open multiple terminals for running and watching the application. After executing pnpm run dev, you can access both the server and watch functionality in a single terminal, streamlining the development workflow.

Running the Application
To run the application, simply use the command: pnpm run dev
This command starts the development server, allowing you to view changes in real time without additional setup.
